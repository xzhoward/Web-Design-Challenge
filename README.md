# Web-Design-Challenge

# Background
Data becomes more powerful when you share it with others! That’s because people can use your data only if they can access it. So, you’ll use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

# Instructions
Create a website by using either the visualizations that you created for your Python-APIs Challenge or the weather data and images that are provided for this Challenge. To do so, use the considerations and website requirements that the following subsections describe. 

# Visualization Pages
latitude vs. max temperature
latitude vs. humidity 
latitude vs. cloudiness 
latitude vs. wind speed
